# StudIQ Frontend

Welcome to the **StudIQ** frontend repository — the user interface of our Smart India Hackathon 2025 project.

## 🔹 About the Project

**StudIQ** is designed to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface for [brief purpose of your project, e.g., “accessing study materials offline and efficiently”].  
This repository contains the **frontend only** (HTML, CSS, and JS combined if applicable).

⚠️ **Note:** The backend originally used a 14-day free trial database (e.g., Firebase), which has now expired. This repository contains **only the frontend code**, but you can still explore the UI and structure.
